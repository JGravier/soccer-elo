#### Annual data for the years 1901-2023

This repo aims to scrap and compile yearly soccer ratings from the
[World Football Elo
Ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings).
Ratings are based on [Elo rating
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), as for FIDE
chess players.

Data in `csv` file is a compilation of yearly final ratings in December
31 from [eloratings](https://www.eloratings.net/). See [initial
table](https://www.eloratings.net/1901) for the year 1901 as an example.
